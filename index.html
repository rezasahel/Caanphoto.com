        <p class="about-p">
          Caan Photo is the first online marketplace for buying and selling
          photos, videos, paintings, and graphics in Afghanistan, established in
          late 2018. The purpose of launching this website is to create a
          creative, educational, and commercial environment for artists to
          directly showcase and sell their works. The founders of this platform
          is Reza Sahel (photographer). One of the significant challenges faced
          by photographers, designers, and artists in Afghanistan and beyond is
          the difficulty in selling their creations both domestically and
          internationally. While numerous websites operate in this field
          globally, Afghan artists, due to various limitations, including Afghan
          banking regulations and security issues, often cannot directly offer
          their work to customers.
